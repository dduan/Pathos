### Fixes

- Warnings in Swift 5.3

### New

- Added a new type `Metadata`, which represents information from `stat` (Darwin,
  Linux).
- Added API to retrieve `Metadata`.
- `PathRepresentable.set(_:)` (permissions)


### Deprecations

The following APIs are deprecated in favor of metadata access APIs.

- `size(atPath)`
- `modificationTime(atPath:)`
- `accessTime(atPath:)`
- `metadataChangeTime(atPath:)`
- `PathRepresentable.size`
- `PathRepresentable.modificationTime`
- `PathRepresentable.accessTime`
- `PathRepresentable.metadataChangeTime`
- `permissions(forPath:)`
- `PathRepresentable.permissions`

Removed adding/removing permissions in favor of directly setting it:

- `add(_:forPath:)`
- `remove(_:forPath:)`
- `PathRepresentable.add(_:)`
- `PathRepresentable.remove(_:)`

Previously symbolic links were referred to as "symbol" or "symbolic link" in
APIs. From this version on, they'll be referred to as "symlink". This resulted
in the following changes:

- `createSymbolicLink(fromPath:toPath:)` -> `createSymlink(fromPath:toPath:)`
- `PathRepresentable.createSymbolicLink(at:)` -> `PathRepresentable.createSymlink(at:)`
- `readSymbolicLink(atPath:toPath)` -> `readSymlink(atPath:toPath)`
- `PathRepresentable.readSymbolicLink()` -> `PathRepresentable.readSymlink()`
- `FileType.symbolicLink` -> `FileType.symlink`

Carthage is no longer supported.

### Breaking changes

Previously symbolic links were referred to as "symbol" or "symbolic link" in
APIs. From this version on, they'll be referred to as "symlink". This resulted
in the following breaking changes:

- `exists(atPath:followSymbol:)` -> `exists(atPath:followSymlink:)`
- `PathRepresentable.exists(followSymbol:)` -> `PathRepresentable.exists(followSymlink:)`
- `copyFile(fromPath:toPath:followSymbolicLink:checkSize:)` -> `copyFile(fromPath:toPath:followSymlink:checkSize:)`
- `PathRepresentable.copy(to:followSymbolicLink:checkSize:)` -> `PathRepresentable.copy(to:followSymlink:checkSize:)`

## 0.2.3

- Re-implemented `children(inPath:recursive)` to fix issue #122

## 0.2.2

- Removed a build warning in Swift 5.2
