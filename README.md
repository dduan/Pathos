For a taste of Pathos, let's generate a static site from Markdown!

```swift
import Pathos

// Set the CWD and execute a closure
try Path("markdown-source-dir").asWorkingDirectory {
    // Build the site in a unique, temporary directory
    let temporaryRoot = try Path.makeTemporaryDirectory()
    
    // Joining path components that works across OSes.
    // E.g. `articles/**/*.md` on POSIX systems.
    let pattern = Path("articles") + "**" + "*.md"
    
    // Use glob to find files that matches the pattern
    for markdown in try pattern.glob() {
        // path/to/file.md => path/to/file
        let url = markdown.base
        
        // path that contains index.html
        let htmlDirectory = temporaryRoot + url
        
        // make a directory, including multiple levels
        try htmlDirectory.makeDirectory(withParents: true)
        
        // read content of a file
        let source = try markdown.readUTF8String()
        
        // write out the html, imagine `markdown2html` exists
        try (htmlDirectory + "index.html").write(markdown2html(source))
    }

    // all done! move the built site to output directory
    try temporaryRoot.move(to: "output")
}
// CWD is restored after the closure is done
```

As you can see, Pathos offers a whole suite of APIs for inspecting and manipulating the file system. Programs built with Pathos compile and work on all supported OS without the need to use `#if OS()` in the source.
