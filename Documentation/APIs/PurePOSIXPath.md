# Pathos API Documentation for `PurePOSIXPath`

```swift
public struct PurePOSIXPath
```

### Conforms to

* [POSIXPathConvertible][]
* CustomStringConvertible
* Equatable
* ExpressibleByStringLiteral
* Hashable

### Initializers

```swift
public init(cString: UnsafePointer<CChar>)
```
Create a `PurePOSIXPath` from an unsafe buffer of `CChar`.

***
```swift
public init(_ string: String)
```

Create a `PurePOSIXPath` from a `String`.

### Properties

```swift
var drive: String?
```

The drive for the path. For POSIX, this is always empty.

***

```swift
var root: String?
```

Root component of the path. For example, on POSIX this is typically "/".

***

```swift
var segments: [String]
```

The segments in the path separated by `Constants.binaryPathSeparator`.
Root is not included.

Example: `Path("/usr/bin/env").segments` is `["usr", "bin", "env"]`.

***

```swift
var name: String?
```

The final path component, if any.

Example: `Path("src/Pathos/README.md").name` is `"README.md"`.

***

```swift
var extension: String?
```

Final suffix that begins with a `.` in the `name` the path. Leading `.`
in the name does not count.

Example: `Path("archive/Pathos.tar.gz").extension` is `"gz"`.

***

```swift
var extensions: [String]
```

Final suffix that begins with a `.` in the `name` the path. Leading `.`
in the name does not count.

Example: `Path("archive/Pathos.tar.gz").extension` is `["tar", "gz"]`.

***

```swift
var base: PurePOSIXPath
```

Path value without the `extension`. 
`path.base + path.extension` should be equal to `path`.

***

```swift
var parent: PurePOSIXPath
```

The logical parent of the path. The parent of an anchor is the anchor itself.
The parent of `.` is `.`. The parent of `/a/b/c` is `/a/b`.

***

```swift
var parents: AnySequence<PurePOSIXPath>
```

A sequence composed of the `self.parent`, `self.parent.parent`, etc. The
final value is either the current context (`Path(".")`) or the root.

Example: `Array(Path("a/b/c")` is `[Path("a/b"), Path("a"), Path(".")]`.

***

```swift
var isEmpty: Bool
```

The path does not have a drive nor a root, and its `segments` is empty.

***

```swift
var isAbsolute: Bool
```

Indicates whether this path is absolute.

An absolute path is one that has a root and, if applicable, a drive.

***

```swift
public var normal: Path
```

Normalize a path by removing redundant separators and up-level
references (`..`). This is a pure computation. It does not access the
file system. Therefore, it may change the meaning of a path that
contains symbolic links.

### Methods

```swift
public func joined(with paths: POSIXPathConvertible) -> Self
public func joined(with paths: [POSIXPathConvertible]) -> Self
```

Joining one or more [POSIXPathConvertible][]s after this one.

**Parameters**

|       |                          |                                      |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| paths | `[POSIXPathConvertible]` | Other values that represents a path. |

**Returns**
|        |                          |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `Path` | Result of joining paths. |

```swift
public static func +(lhs: PurePOSIXPath, rhs: PurePOSIXPath) -> PurePOSIXPath
public static func +(lhs: PurePOSIXPath, rhs: POSIXPathConvertible) -> PurePOSIXPath
public static func +(lhs: POSIXPathConvertible, rhs: PurePOSIXPath) -> PurePOSIXPath
```

`+` operators that enable path creation with code like `"/" + myPath + "file.md"`.

_ยน an important reason these need to be addressed separately is we want to avoid overloading `+`
when value on both sides are `String`s._

***

```swift
public func relative(to other: POSIXPathConvertible) -> PurePOSIXPath
```

Return a relative path to `self` from `other`. This is a pure computatian.
File system is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of `self`
or `other`.

For example, `Path("a/b/c").relative(to: Path("a/b"))` evaluates to
`Path("c")`. That is to say, to get to "a/b/c" from "a/b", one go through
"c".

**Parameters**

|       |                   |                             |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| other | `PathConvertible` | the path to start from.<br> |

**Returns**
|        |                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Path` | the path that leads from `other` to `self`. |
